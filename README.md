./Data:
processed_data_under
model_results		

./Data/model_results:
dt		
result_dict	
svm
lr		
rf		
xgb

## Instructions
All codes are in notebooks, so it is easy to run as long as packages are installed according to the requirements.txt

## Note
I remove the processed_data_over, and clean_data which is the data after over-sampling. They are too large to upload. If you would like to run the code, in particular the Q3, you should run Q1 first.
